\section description Introduction

This document describes briefly the recommended procedure of releasing
a new version of StdAir using a Linux development machine and the
SourceForge project site.

The following steps are required to make a release of the distribution package.


\section initialisation Initialisation

Check out locally the full
<a href="https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair">Subversion project</a>:
\verbatim 
cd ~
mkdir -p dev
cd ~/dev
svn co https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair stdairsvn
\endverbatim 


\section branch_preparation Branch preparation

Prepare the branch for its creation on the Subversion repository:
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/branches/stdair
mkdir 0.8.0
svn add 0.8.0
svn ci -m "[Branch 0.8.0] Prepared the branch 0.8.0 to be copied from head of the trunk."
\endverbatim 

\section check_release_revision Check Subversion revision for the release

Check to which Subversion revision the release corresponds to. For instance
the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/changeset/360/">StdAir
	release 0.8.0 corresponds to Subversion revision r360</a>.
The trunk <tt>configure.ac</tt> file specifies a fake release number, namely
99.99.99,
for current (head) development. When a release is made, two Subversion 
revisions are committed with, as the sole change, the release number within
the <tt>configure.ac</tt> file:
- one revision is committed with the to-be-released version number (e.g.,
  0.8.0) and commit message prefixed with "[Release x.y.z]",
- and another one with the release number back to 99.99.99 and message stating
  "[Release] Back to working version (99.99.99)."
.
That way, it is then easy to spot the starting point of any release within
the Subversion repository, with something like:
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/trunk/stdair
svn log configure.ac | less
\endverbatim 


\section create_release_branch Create the release branch

Create a release branch by copying the
<a href="https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair/trunk/stdair">source
   tree</a> to be released, from the found revision (e.g., 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/changeset/360">r360</a>)
into the dedicated 
<a href="https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair/branches/stdair/0.8.0">'branches' sub-directory of the Subversion repository</a>, e.g.:
\verbatim 
svn copy -r360 \
 https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair/trunk/stdair \
 https://stdair.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stdair/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main \
 -m "[Release] Created the main 0.8.0 release branch, from revision r360."
\endverbatim 

Check the results:<br>
\c firefox -new-tab \"<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/browser/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main">http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/browser/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main</a>\"


\section checkout_new_release Check-out the new release

Check-out the release StdAir sources from the branch, so that patches
may be made (for instance, on the RPM specification file):
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/branches/stdair/0.8.0
svn up
cd main
\endverbatim 


\section alter_released_files Alter released files

<b>Only if needed</b>, alter a few files on the branch.

<b>Note that the release branch is not the place where to develop for a 
release.</b>
The <b>release</b> branch is aimed at keeping track of a release and of all
the patches having made their way into that branch, so that the software
can always be generated according to that release.

Developments for a particular release should be made on the trunk (e.g., by
adding features not activated by default, but activated for the release
developers only) or, if really needed, on a dedicated <b>development</b> branch.


\section create_packages Create distribution packages

Create the distribution packages using the following command:<br>
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main
./autogen.sh && make distcheck
\endverbatim 


This will configure, compile and check the package. The output packages will
be named, for instance, <tt>stdair-0.8.0.tar.gz</tt> and
<tt>stdair-0.8.0.tar.bz2</tt>.


\section generate_rpm_packages Generation the RPM packages

Optionally, generate the RPM package (for instance, for 
<a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>/<a href="http://www.redhat.com">RedHat</a>):
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main
./autogen.sh && make dist
\endverbatim 

To perform this step, autoconf, automake and libtool tools have to be
available in the system.
\verbatim 
cp stdair.spec ~/dev/packages/SPECS \
  && cp stdair-0.8.0.tar.bz2 ~/dev/packages/SOURCES
cd ~/dev/packages/SPECS
rpmbuild -ba stdair.spec
rpmlint -i ../SPECS/stdair.spec ../SRPMS/stdair-0.8.0-1.fc13.src.rpm \
  ../RPMS/i686/stdair-*
\endverbatim 


\section update_changelog Update distributed change log

Update the \c NEWS and \c ChangeLog files with appropriate
information, including what has changed since the previous release. Then
commit the changes into the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/browser">StdAir's 
  Subversion (SVN) repository</a>.


\section create_doc_packages Create the documentation packages

Create the documentation packages using the following command:
<tt>make dist-html</tt> and <tt>make dist-tex</tt>

The output documentation packages will be named, for instance:
- <tt>stdair-doc-0.8.0.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>stdair-doc-0.8.0.tar.bz2</tt>
  for the HTML documentation.
- <tt>stdair-pdf-0.8.0.tar.gz</tt> and <tt>stdair-pdf-0.8.0.tar.bz2</tt>
  for the PDF documentation.


\section upload_files Upload the files to SourceForge

Upload the distribution and documentation packages to the SourceForge server.
Check
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download#SCP">SourceForge help page on uploading software</a>.


\section upload_doc Upload the documentation to SourceForge

In order to update the Web site files, either:
- <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service#Accessingyourfileswithothertools">synchronise them with rsync and SSH</a>:
\verbatim 
cd ~/dev
cd stdairsvn/branches/stdair/0.8.0/main
rsync -aiv doc/html/ joe,stdair@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/
\endverbatim 
where \c -aiv options mean:
  - \c -a: archive/mirror mode; equals \c -rlptgoD
    (no \c -H, \c -A, \c -X)
  - \c -v: increase verbosity
  - \c -i: output a change-summary for all updates
  - Note the trailing slashes (/) at the end of both the source and target 
    directories. It means that the content of the source directory 
    (<tt>doc/html</tt>), rather than the directory itself, has to be copied
    into the content of the target directory.
- or use the
 <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service">SourceForge Shell service</a>.


\section post_news Make a new post

- submit a new entry in the
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/news/submit.php?group_id=267760">SourceForge
  project-related news feed</a>
- make a new post on the
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/wordpress/stdair/wp-admin/">SourceForge
  hosted WordPress blog</a>
- and update, if necessary,
  <a href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/stdair/report">Trac tickets</a>.


\section send_announce Send an email on the announcement mailing-list

Finally, you should send an announcement to
  <a href="mailto:stdair-announce@lists.sourceforge.net">stdair-announce@lists.sourceforge.net</a>
  (see <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/stdair-announce">https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/stdair-announce</a>
  for the archives)
