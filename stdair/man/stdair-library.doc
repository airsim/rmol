\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

The Standard Airline IT (STDAIR) library is a collection of routines

for very high level languages.

The library covers the following areas:

  - Network, ReachableUniverse
- (Air) Travel-related classes:
  - TravelSolution, OriginDestination, 
- (Airline) Inventory-related classes:

    LegDate, LegCabin,

- (Airline) Schedule-related classes:
  - FlightPeriod, SegmentPeriod, LegPeriod
- (Simulated) Passenger-related demand classes:
  - DemandStream, BookingRequest
