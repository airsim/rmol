Summary:
--------
RMOL is a C++ library of Revenue Management and Optimisation classes 
and functions. Typically, that library may be used by service providers
(e.g., airlines offering flight seats, hotels offering rooms, rental car
companies offering rental days, broadcasting company offering advertisement 
slots, theaters offering seats, etc.) to help in optimising their revenues 
from seat capacities.
Most of the algorithms implemented are public and documented in the 
following book:
The Theory and practice of Revenue Management, by Kalyan T. Talluri and
Garrett J. van Ryzin, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004, ISBN 1-4020-7701-7

RMOL makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

RMOL is the one of the components of the Travel Market Simulator
(http://www.travel-market-simulator). However, it may be used in a
stand-alone mode.


Getting and installing from the Fedora/CentOS/RedHat distribution:
------------------------------------------------------------------
Just use Yum:
yum -y install rmol-devel rmol-doc

You can also get the RPM packages (which may work on Linux
distributions like Novel Suse and Mandriva) from the Fedora repository
(e.g., for Fedora 18, 
http://fr2.rpmfind.net/linux/fedora/releases/18/Everything/)


Building the library and test binary from Git repository:
---------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Git repository may be cloned as following:
git clone ssh://git.code.sf.net/p/rmol/code rmolgit
cd rmolgit
git checkout trunk

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora/RedHat/CentOS names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * cmake
  * gcc-c++
  * stdair-devel, airrac-devel
  * boost-devel
  * zeromq-devel
  * readline-devel, ncurses-devel
  * soci-mysql-devel
  * python-devel
  * gettext-devel (optional)
  * doxygen, ghostscript, graphviz and tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build (optional)

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (rmol*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=177703

To customise the following to your environment, you can alter the path
to the installation directory:
export INSTALL_BASEDIR=/home/user/dev/deliveries
export LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE="-DLIB_SUFFIX=64"

Then, as usual:
* To configure the project, type something like:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-99.99.99 \
   -DWITH_STDAIR_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/stdair-stable \
   -DWITH_AIRRAC_PREFIX=${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/airrac-stable \
   -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug -DENABLE_TEST:BOOL=ON -DINSTALL_DOC:BOOL=ON \
   -DRUN_GCOV:BOOL=OFF ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
   ${LIBSUFFIX_4_CMAKE} ..
* To build the project, type:
  make
* To test the project, type:
  make check
* To install the library (librmol*.so*) and the binary (rmol),
  make install
* To package the source files, type:
  make dist
* To package the binary and the (HTML and PDF) documentation:
  make package
* To browse the (just installed, if enabled) HTML documentation:
  midori file://${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-99.99.99/share/doc/rmol-99.99.99/html/index.html
* To browse the (just installed, if enabled) PDF documentation:
  evince ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-99.99.99/share/doc/rmol-99.99.99/html/refman.pdf
* To run the local binary version:
  ./rmol/rmol -b
* To run the installed version:
  ${INSTALL_BASEDIR}/rmol-99.99.99/bin/rmol -b
