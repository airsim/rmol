Building the library and test binary from Subversion repository:
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Sourceforge Subversion repository is to be found here:
svn co https://rmol.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/rmol/trunk rmolsvn

Then, you need the following packages (Fedora Core 6 names here, 
but names may vary according to distributions):
  * libtool, autoconf, automake
  * gettext-devel
  * gcc-c++
  * gsl-devel
  * boost-devel
  * doxygen
  * tetex-latex (optional)
  * rpm-build

Building the library and test binary from the tarball:
------------------------------------------------------
The latest stable source tarball (rmol*.tar.gz or .bz2) can be found here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=177703

Then, as usual, you can just type the following sequence:
"./configure --prefix=~/dev/deliveries/rmol-0.15 && make && make check && cd test && ./testLibsh"
Of course, if you want to install the library (librmol*.so*), 
just type: "make install".

See the INSTALL file for more details.
