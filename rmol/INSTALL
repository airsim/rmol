Logically enough, that package requires the GSL (as it is an extension
to it). Hence, the path to the GSL installation directory
(GSL_ROOTDIR variable) needs to be overwritten in the Makefile, if it
is not in a standard directory (for insance, if it is in /usr/local,
there is no need to define that variable).

In the makefile, you will need to overwrite the PROC64 variable if
your processor is not 64bits. For instance, for 32-bit-processor, just
leave that variable blank.

By the way, if you know how to write a config.in file, please don't
hesitate to contribute, as launching "configure" would be a more
convenient way to start the installation of that project.

Then, just type "make" (or "gmake"). It generates a dynamic library,
namely "libstats.so", against which you can then link your own
programs. An example (C++) program is also delivered, namely "stats",
which uses that library.

For the installation, you will need to overwritte the target
installation directory (INSTALL_ROOTDIR variable). Then, just type
"make install".  Of course, if the install directory is only writeable
by root (which is the case for /usr/local), you will need to be root
when typing "make install".

If you want to develop using the extended-GSL API, you will need to
include the header file (namely "gsl_statext.h").
