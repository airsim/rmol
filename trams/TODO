The calculation of a single daily rate for the whole CityPair object
is not good. Indeed, a daily rate must be calculated/pro-rated for each
departure date, and those daily rates must be added up into
the total daily rate of the CityPair.
Also, the start and end dates have no meaning for the CityPair. Only
departure dates (or schedules) have got a meaning.

Add other BOM classes for the DepDate and ClassPath distributions.
