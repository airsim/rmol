\page test Test Rules

This section describes rules how the functionality of the IT++
library should be verified. In the \c `tests' subdirectory test files
are provided. All functionality should be tested using these test
files.


\section test_file The Test File

Each new IT++ module/class should be accompanied with a test file. The
test file is an implementation in C++ that tests the functionality of
a function/class or a group of functions/classes called modules. The
test file should test relevant parameter settings and input/output
relations to guarantee correct functionality of the corresponding
classes/functions. The test files should be maintained using version
control and updated whenever new functionality is added to the IT++
library.

The test file should print relevant data to a standard output that can
be used to verify the functionality. All relevant parameter settings
should be tested.

The test file should be placed in the \c `tests' subdirectory and
should have a name ending with <tt>`_test.cpp'</tt>.


\section reference_file The Reference File

Consider a test file named <tt>`module_test.cpp'</tt>. A reference
file named <tt>`module_test.ref'</tt> should accompany the test
file. The reference file contains a reference printout of the standard
output generated when running the test program. The reference file
should be maintained using version control and updated according to
the test file.


\section testing_using_make Testing IT++ Library

One can compile and execute all test programs from \c `tests'
subdirectory by typing
\verbatim 
% make check 
\endverbatim after
successful compilation of the IT++ library.
