\page itfile Writing and reading data from files

Here we will use the \c it_file class to store some data. The program \c
write_it_file.cpp looks as follows:

\include write_it_file.cpp

When you run this program you will obtain a file called \c it_file_test.it
in your current directory. You can read the file into Matlab/Octave to view
the data by using the following commands:

\code
itload('it_file_test.it')
figure(1); clf;
plot(a)
\endcode

Note: Make sure that <tt>$PREFIX/share/itpp</tt> is in your Matlab/Octave
path and that you run the code above from the directory where \c
it_file_test.it is located (\c $PREFIX is the IT++ installation prefix; 
<tt>/usr/local</tt> by default).  

The IT++ program \c read_it_file.cpp that reads the file and prints its
content can look like this: 

\include read_it_file.cpp

Here is the output of the program:

\verbatim
a = [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20]
\endverbatim
*/
