\section tut_introduction Introduction
This page contains some tutorial examples that will help you getting
started using StdAir. Most examples show how to construct some simple
business objects, i.e., instances of the so-named Business Object
Model (BOM).

\subsection tut_intro_configuration Preparing the StdAir Project for Development

The source code for these examples can be found in the
<tt>batches</tt> and <tt>test/stdair</tt> directories. They are
compiled along with the rest of the \c StdAir project. See the User
Guide (\ref users_guide) for more details on how to build the \c StdAir
project.

\section tut_build_bom_tree Build a Predefined BOM Tree
A few steps:
- \ref tut_build_bom_root
- \ref tut_build_inventory
- \ref tut_build_link

\subsection tut_build_bom_root Instanciate the BOM Root Object

\dontinclude CmdBomManager.cpp

First, a BOM root object (i.e., a root for all the classes in the project) 
is instantiated by the <tt>stdair::STDAIR_ServiceContext</tt> context object,
when the <tt>stdair::STDAIR_Service</tt> is itself instantiated. The 
corresponding \c StdAir type (class) is <tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>.

In the following sample, that object is named \c ioBomRoot, and is given
as input/output parameter of the
<tt>stdair::CmdBomManager::buildSampleBom()</tt> method:

\skipline ioBomRoot

\subsection tut_build_inventory Instanciate the (Airline) Inventory Object

An airline inventory object can then be instantiated. Let us give it
the "BA" airline code (corresponding to <a
href="http://www.ba.com">British Airways</a>) as the object key. That
is, an object (let us name it \c lBAKey) of type (class)
<tt>stdair::InventoryKey</tt> has first to be instantiated.

\skipline lBAKey

Thanks to that key, an airline inventory object, i.e. of type (class)
<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>, can be instantiated. Let us name that
airline inventory object \c lBAInv.

\skipline lBAInv

\subsection tut_build_link Link the Inventory Object with the BOM Root

Then, both objects have to be linked: the airline inventory object
(<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>) has to be linked with the root of the BOM
tree (<tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>). That operation is as simple as using the 
<tt>stdair::FacBomManager::addToListAndMap()</tt> method:

\line addToListAndMap
\line linkWithParent

\subsection tut_build_inventory_another Build Another Airline Inventory

Another airline inventory object, corresponding to the Air France (<a
href="http://www.airfrance.com">Air France</a>) company, is
instantiated the same way:

\skipline lAFKey
\until linkWithParent

See the corresponding full program (\ref cmd_bom_manager_cpp) for more details.

\subsection tut_dump_bom_tree Dump The BOM Tree Content

\dontinclude BomDisplay.cpp

From the \c BomRoot (of type <tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>) object
instance, the list of airline inventories (of type
<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>) can then be retrieved...

\skipline lInventoryList
\line getList

... and browsed:
\skipline const_iterator
\until csvDisplay

See the corresponding full program (\ref bom_display_cpp) for more details.

\subsection tut_result_output Result of the Tutorial Program

When the <tt>stdair.cpp</tt> program is run (with the <tt>-b</tt>
option), the output should look like:

\include stdair.ref

See the corresponding full program (\ref batch_stdair_cpp) for more details.


\section tut_extend_bom_tree Extend the Pre-Defined BOM Tree

Now that we master how to instantiate the pre-defined StdAir classes,
let us see how to extend that BOM.

\subsection tut_extend_inventory Extend an Airline Inventory Object
For instance, let us assume that some (IT) provider (e.g., you) would
like to have a specific implementation of the \c Inventory object. The
corresponding class has just to extend the <tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>
class:

\dontinclude MPInventory.hpp

\skipline namespace
\skipline class Inventory

The STL containers have to be defined accordingly too:

\skipline InventoryList_T

See the full class definition (\ref test_archi_inv_hpp) and
implementation (\ref test_archi_inv_cpp) for more details.

\subsection tut_extend_build Build the Specific BOM Objects

\dontinclude StandardAirlineITTestSuite.cpp

The BOM root object (<tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>) is instantiated the
classical way:

\skipline lBomRoot
\line FacBom

Then, the specific implementation of the airline inventory object
(<tt>myprovider::Inventory</tt>) can be instantiated the same way as a
standard Inventory (<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>) would be:

\skipline lBAKey
\skipline lBAInv
\line FacBom

Then, the specific implementation of the airline inventory object
(<tt>myprovider::Inventory</tt>) is linked to the root of the BOM tree
(<tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>) the same way as the standard Inventory
(<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>) would be:

\skipline addToList

Another specific airline inventory object is instantiated the same way:

\skipline lAFKey
\until FacBomManager

From the \c BomRoot (of type <tt>stdair::BomRoot</tt>) object
instance, the list of specific airline inventories (of type
<tt>stdair::Inventory</tt>) can then be retrieved...

\skipline lInventoryList
\line getList

... and browsed:
\skipline const_iterator
\until }

\subsection tut_extend_result_output Result of the Tutorial Program

When this program is run, the output should look like:

\include StandardAirlineITTestSuite.ref

See the corresponding full program (\ref StandardAirlineITTestSuite_cpp) for
more details.
