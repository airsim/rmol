\page qpsk_simulation Simulation of QPSK modulation on an AWGN channel

In this example we will introduce a few new features compared to the BPSK example. We will use the it_ifile class to store the results of the simulation. We will use the Real_Timer class to measure the execution time of our program. Furthermore we will use one of the channel classes, the AWGN_Channel. We will also show how to read the results in to Matlab with the load_it function. The program is as follows:

\include qpsk_simulation.cpp

When you run this program, the output will look something like this:

\include qpsk_simulation.ref

Now it is time to plot the simulation results in Matlab and compare with theory using the Matlab code below.
The results will be stored in a file called "qpsk_result_file.it". Make sure load_it.m is in your Matlab path 
(look in $(ITXX_HOME)/matlab) and that you run the example code below from the directory where qpsk_result_file.it is located

\code
figure(1); clf;
load_it qpsk_result_file.it
h1 = semilogy(EbN0dB,ber,'*-r'); hold on
ebn0db = 0:.1:10;
ebn0 = 10.^(ebn0db/10);
Pb = 0.5 * erfc(sqrt(ebn0));
h2 = semilogy(ebn0db,Pb);
set(gca,'fontname','times','fontsize',16);
xlabel('{\it E_b} / {\it N}_0 [dB]');
ylabel('BER')
title('QPSK on an AWGN Channel');

grid on;
\endcode
