\page convcode Simulation of a convolutional encoder and decoder

In this example we will show how to use the convolutional encoder/decoder class in it++. The Viterbi decoder uses the soft received values.
 
\include convcode.cpp

When you run this program, the output will look something like this:

\include convcode.ref
