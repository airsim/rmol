As noticed by Jason Tibbitts <tibbs@math.uh.edu> on June 6, 2009, the license
is a bit unclear. DESCRIPTION states "GPL-2", but src/pijt.c, the only other
file which seems to have a license, uses the FSF-recommended language and
states GPLv2+. That needed to be clarified with upstream.

The maintainer, namely Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora@m4x.org>, therefore
sent an email to the (R-)msm project owner, namely Chris Jackson
<chris.jackson@mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk>, to clarify that license issue. Following is
a copy of the corresponding emails, including the answer from the project
owner: the license was intended to be GPLv2+.

Dear Denis,

Thanks for pointing that out, it was an oversight. I will alter the DESCRIPTION
file to put the whole package under GPL version 2 or later. I am working on
several updates and bug fixes at the moment, so I intend to release the next
version with this change within the next two weeks.

Thanks for packaging it - it has also recently been included in Debian!

Chris

Note: when the license statement will be clarified upstream, that README file
will be removed from the (R-msm) RPM package.
