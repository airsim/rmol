\title{Aortic aneurysm progression data}
\description{
  This dataset contains longitudinal measurements of grades of aortic
  aneurysms,  measured by ultrasound examination of the
  diameter of the aorta. 
  
}
\usage{data(aneur)}

\format{
  A data frame containing 4337 rows, with each row corresponding to an
  ultrasound scan from one of 838 men over 65 years of age.

  \tabular{rll}{
    \code{ptnum}   \tab (numeric) \tab Patient identification number \cr
    \code{age}     \tab (numeric) \tab Recipient age at examination (years) \cr
    \code{diam}   \tab (numeric) \tab Aortic diameter\cr
    \code{state} \tab (numeric) \tab State of aneurysm. \cr
  }

  The states represent successive degrees of aneurysm severity, as
  indicated by the aortic diameter. 

  \tabular{rll}{
    State 1 \tab Aneurysm-free \tab < 30 cm \cr
    State 2 \tab Mild aneurysm \tab 30-44 cm \cr
    State 3 \tab Moderate aneurysm \tab 45-54 cm \cr
    State 4 \tab Severe aneurysm \tab > 55 cm \cr
  }

  683 of these men were aneurysm-free at age 65 and were re-screened every two
  years.  The remaining men were aneurysmal at entry and had successive
  screens with frequency depending on the state of the aneurysm.
  Severe aneurysms are repaired by surgery.
