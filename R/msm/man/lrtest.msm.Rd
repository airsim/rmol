\title{Likelihood ratio test}
\description{Likelihood ratio test between two or more fitted multi-state models}
\usage{
lrtest.msm(...)
}
\arguments{

  \item{...}{Two or more fitted multi-state models, as returned by
    \code{\link{msm}}, supplied in increasing order of complexity.}

}
\value{
  A matrix with three columns, giving the likelihood ratio statistic,
  difference in degrees of freedom and the chi-squared p-value for a
  comparison of the first model supplied with each subsequent model.
}
\section{Warning}{
  The comparison between models will only be valid if
  they are fitted to the same dataset. This may be a problem if
  there are missing values and R's default of 'na.action = na.omit'
  is used.

  The likelihood ratio statistic only has the indicated chi-squared
  distribution if the models are nested. An alternative for comparing
  non-nested models is Akaike's information criterion.
