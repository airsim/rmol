\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

The Revenue Management Optimisation Library (RMOL) is a collection of
routines for revenue management calculations.  The routines are
written from scratch by the RMOL team in C++, and present a modern
Applications Programming Interface (API) for C/C++ programmers,
allowing wrappers to be written for very high level languages.

The library covers the following areas:
- Forecast
- Single Resource Optimisation
- Multiple Resource (Network / O&D) Optimisation
- Overbooking
